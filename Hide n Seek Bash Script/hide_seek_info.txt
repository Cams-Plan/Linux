STEP 2)
    Find your shell interpreter path (bash) and put it into the .sh file 
    - enter the command 'which bash' into your terminal to find the path to execute bash. e.g. /usr/bin/bash or /bin/bash
        *iF YOUR PATH IS /usr/bin/bash, THEN SKIP TO STEP 3* - if not, then continue
    -copy that path
    - edit the .hide_seek.sh file using nano, and enter that path after #! e.g. #!/bin/bash 

STEP 3)
    Edit the file paths in the .sh file
    - use and editor to edit the .hide_seek.sh file
    - any comment that says *EDIT THE COMMENT BELOW* has commands that need to be modified to suit your machine
        where you see <HOME DIRECTORY>, replace it with your home directory path. e.g. /home/jbloggs/



Commands Used:
    mv (hiding and un-hiding files)

    using a file editor to ensure there's a match. If not, change the path so it matches your terminal.
